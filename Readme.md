8. Revenue Comparison Between Occasions: Compare revenue generated across
different occasions.
9. Product Popularity by Occasion: Identify which products are most popular during
specific occasions.

# Tools I Used 
For my deep dive into the data analyst FNP, I harnessed the power of several key tools on Microsoft Excel:

- **Power Query:** The backbone of my Excel analysis, used to extract, clean, and transform raw grocery store data into a structured and analysis-ready format.
- **Excel Sheet:** The primary data management environment, where the cleaned dataset is stored, explored, and prepared for analysis.
- **Pivot Table:** My main analytical tool for summarizing data, performing aggregations, and replicating SQL-like operations such as grouping, filtering, and calculated fields.
- **Chart:** Used to visualize insights and trends, making the analysis easier to interpret, communicate, and present to stakeholders.

# The Analysis
### 1. Transforming Dataset Using Power Query
In this project, I processed and analyzed the FNP dataset entirely using Microsoft Excel. My workflow began with importing raw data and cleaning it using Power Query, ensuring consistency in formats, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

### 2. Build Data Modeling and Analysis Using Power Pivot and Pivot Tables
Once the data was structured, I used Power Pivot to Manage the data model and build a connection that i can analyzing all the data in the pivot tables letter.
